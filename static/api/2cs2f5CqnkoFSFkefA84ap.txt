A phony, a fake, but I am a hypocrite with the best intentions
And I need kissing desperately
A traitor leader is the outcome
But I'm so cold

Why don't you people go home?
Are you heaving a bad time?
Cause I don't think I've ever been so ready before
I heard you say that you wanna go home
Are you having a bad time?
Well make it yours

Well give me a song and I'll sing it like I mean it
Are you warmed up? Well I'm still damn cold

Sing with the heart of a traitor I sing 

Why don't you people go home?
Are you heaving a bad time?
Cause I don't think I've ever been so ready before
I heard you say that you wanna go home
Are you having a bad time?
Well make it yours

Sing with the heart of a traitor I sing 

Why don't you people go home?
Are you heaving a bad time?
Cause I don't think I've ever been so ready before
I heard you say that you wanna go home
Are you having a bad time?
Well make it yours
