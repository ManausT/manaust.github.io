You wanted power and you begged for fame
You wanted everything the easy way
You wanted gain without pain
Now your bill is in the mail

You got stronger but your mind got weak
You made a promise that you couldn't keep
You had it all, you lost it all
It's all there in the fee

Via hell incorporated (Regeneration)
First you love it, then you hate it (You're such a saint)
And now you're never gonna make it (Bad situation)
Get on, get on down
There's hell to pay

'Cause the devil is a loser and he's my bitch
For better or for worse and you don't care which
'Cause the devil is a loser and he's my bitch
Running into trouble, you skitch
He's my bitch

You wanted riches and a license to kill
You got poverty, then you got ill
You got poor and you lost your will
All your dreams unfulfilled

Wow, I get my kicks when you blow your fuse
No one got killed but that's no excuse
Hands up, I let you know when it's done
I got the only gun

Via hell incorporated (Regeneration)
First you love it, then you hate it (You're such a saint)
And now you're never gonna make it (Bad situation)
Get on, get on down
There's hell to pay

'Cause the devil is a loser and he's my bitch
For better or for worse and you don't care which
'Cause the devil is a loser and he's my bitch
Running into trouble, you skitch

And there were no refunds (Devil is a loser)
Just failing guarantees (Devil is a loser)
Confess your sins, son (Devil is a loser)
Said the preacher on TV (Devil is a loser)

You got yourself some greasepaint
Ooh, set of white and black
Wow, all you got was laughter
And Gene Simmons on your back

'Cause the devil is a loser and he's my bitch
For better or for worse and you don't care which
'Cause the devil is a loser and he's my bitch
Running into trouble, you skitch
He's my bitch

(Devil is a loser and he's my bitch)
For better or for worse and you don't care which
'Cause the devil is a loser and he's my bitch
Running into trouble, you skitch, yeah!
Running into trouble, you skitch, wow!
Running into trouble, you skitch!
