Stand up for god in the land of the fire
Bring on the madness, you're born to destroy
Beyond the trail of Tartarean riders
Armata Strigoi

Before the morning can break we retire
The searing heat of the sun we avoid
Await the dark, proud Walachian fighters
Armata Strigoi

We are the stormbound
The avatar
All we are the sons of god and sorrow
We are the ones who see no tomorrow
Suck up!
Armata de Strigoi

We hail the cross and we kill by the bible
For seven sins are defined to deploy
Along the front of Moldavian strikers
Armata strigoi

We pray for mercy of Mater Maria
The sacred lie who gave birth to the boy
We drink the blood of the fallen believer
Armata Strigoi

We are the stormbound
The avatar
All we are the sons of god and sorrow
We are the ones who see no tomorrow
Suck up!
Armata de Strigoi
