Miles 'till the end of the road we walk
Miles 'till the end of the road we walk
Miles 'till the end of the road we walk
Miles 'till the end of the road we walk

We came as Romans to
Put money where your mouth was
We walked these miles for you
To hold your hands in the blue

Hey, I never asked for your city walls
Walk on, walk on!
Walk 44 miles for you, walk 44 miles
Walk on, walk on!
Walk 44 miles

Children we did not sleep

We came as brothers, died
We came as sisters, cried
He held his hands up high
We tried to stop them from bleeding

Hey, I never asked for your city walls
Walk on, walk on!
Walk 44 miles for you, walk 44 miles
Walk on, walk on!
Walk 44 miles

Miles 'till the end of the road we walk
Miles!

Yeah we tried to bring you
Bring you down to the
Ground boy, die boy!

Yeah we tried to bring you
Bring you down to the
Ground boy, die boy
Ground boy, die boy!

He held his hands up high
We walked these miles for you
Children we did not sleep
Children we did not sleep

Miles 'till the end of the road we walk
Miles 'till the end of the road we walk
Miles 'till the end of the road we walk
Miles 'till the end of the road we walk
