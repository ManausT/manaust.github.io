The house is slightly askew
Get to the panic room

And we’ll be safe inside our fortress when they come
(When they come)
We’ll be safe from creeps and killers when they come
(When they come)
Unless they’ve got a blow torch or a poison gas injector
Then I don’t know what will happen when they come
(When they come)
