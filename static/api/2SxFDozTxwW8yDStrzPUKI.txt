You are nothing
You are nothing to me
You're a useless fucking cunt
You are nothing to me

I don't ever wanna feel like anything I do
Ever had a fucking resonance or meant a thing to you
I fucking hate you
Yeah I hate you

And I wish you would die
It makes me violently angry when I see you alive
You're a fucking mistake, you're an embarrassment mate
You think you're funny and you're clever but you're just a disgrace

I wanna hit you with the force of an asteroid from space
I wanna fall out of the sky right into your stupid face
I wanna smash you like extinction as if you life was just a waste
I wanna be a fucking dagger right between your shoulder blades
I fucking hate you
Oh I hate you

I hate you
And I wish you would die 

I fucking hate you

I fucking hate you
I hate you
I fucking hate you
I fucking hate you
Yes I do
