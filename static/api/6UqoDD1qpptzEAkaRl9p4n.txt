Draw an X on my forehead and cross me out
Call me lonely and lost but I wanna be found
For all those mistakes I could have made right
I walk out and die on this stage every night
Let me up let me up
I wanna break my neck
Cut me into pieces till there's nothing left

Even on my own
You can't stop me
Even on my own
I am the juggernaut
Even on my own
You can't stop me
Even on my own
I am the juggernaut
You can't stop me
Even on my own
I am the juggernaut
Even on my own

Put a arrow in my heart
And a spear in my side
Cut my wrists and my throat
Tear out my fucking eye
Wrap me up in chains all soaked in petrol
Well choking in the gallows like a wretched devil
Nail me up for the world to see
Set fire to the cross that is carrying me
Hang me up, hang me up
Go on and break my neck
Cut me into pieces till there's nothing left

Even on my own
You can't stop me
Even on my own
I am the juggernaut
Even on my own
You can't stop me
Even on my own
I am the juggernaut
You can't stop me
Even on my own
I am the juggernaut

I AM THE JUGGERNAUT

Even on my own
You can't stop me
Even on my own
I am the juggernaut
Even on my own
You can't stop me
Even on my own
I am the juggernaut
