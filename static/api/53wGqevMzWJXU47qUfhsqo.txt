I broke my neck on a step in the hospital
And then the medics came and it was all so wonderful

This spec on my head says I'll soon be dead
There's a slim chance of healing while doctors are everywhere
With a recess of thought on suspicious grounds
A tumor or cancer is easily found

They're howling along like wolves in the woods
The treatment is ill and the drugs are no good
But if the ways of the belly equal the mind
You'll see, the sheep and the wolf are alike

So I set it to go and I set it to go
So I set it to go and I set it to go
How would you feel if your time was running out?
How would you feel if your time was running

I broke my neck on a step in the hospital
And then the medics came and it was all so wonderful
I broke my neck on a step in the hospital

They're howling along like wolves in the woods
The treatment is ill and the drugs are no good
But if the ways of the belly equal the mind
You'll see, the sheep and the wolf are alike

I'm going there to see my father
He said he'd meet me when I come

So I set it to go and I set it to go
So I set it to go and I set it to go
So I set it to go and I set it to go
So I set it to go and I set it to go
How would you feel if your time was running out?

I broke my neck on a step in the hospital
And then the medics came and it was all so wonderful
I broke my neck on a step in the hospital

This spec on my head says I'll soon be dead
There's a slim chance of healing while doctors are everywhere
With a recess of thought on suspicious grounds
It's gonna be alright, it's gonne be alright

I'm going there to see my father
He said he'd meet me when I come
