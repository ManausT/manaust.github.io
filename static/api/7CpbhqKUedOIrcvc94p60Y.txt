Let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the... floor!

Beaten why for (why for)
Can't take much more
(Here we go, here we go, here we go now)

One – Nothing wrong with me
Two – Nothing wrong with me
Three – Nothing wrong with me
Four – Nothing wrong with me
One – Something's got to give
Two – Something's got to give
Three – Something's got to give now

Let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the...
Let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the...

Now, push me again (again)
This is the end
(Here we go, here we go, here we go now)

One – Nothing wrong with me
Two – Nothing wrong with me
Three – Nothing wrong with me
Four – Nothing wrong with me
One – Something's got to give
Two – Something's got to give
Three – Something's got to give now

Let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the...
Let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the floor

Skin against skin, blood and bone
You're all by yourself, but you're not alone
You wanted in and now you're here
Driven by hate, consumed by fear

Let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the floor

One – Nothing wrong with me
Two – Nothing wrong with me
Three – Nothing wrong with me
Four – Nothing wrong with me
One – Something's got to give
Two – Something's got to give
Three – Something's got to give now

Let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the floor

Hey, drop! Hey, drop!
Hey, drop!  Hey, drop!
